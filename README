!!! A WORK IN PROGRESS !!! (Changing/Fixing as I use it :)

A simple Tcl only Web framework for small systems like the Raspberry Pi etc..

A one-night hack, with later additions. A work in progress...

Goals:
    - To be a simple lightweight web framework similar to Flask.  
    - Offer easy but flexible URL routing with a built-in web server.
    - Have at least some REST-like uses.
    - No external dependencies with an all-in-one source file. (Minus TLS :)

Documentation forthcoming.

TODO:
    - Document the lib
    - Add forwarding.
    - Add TLS support.
    - Possibly add page templating.

Usage:

Copy the temberweb folder to your local tcl lib directory and use 'package require Temberweb'
Or copy to your project directory and use 'source temberweb.tcl'
